# Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep - Ability/Skill List

This is a dynamic list that I made a few years ago mostly for personal use. The list allows you to select all possible results by searching by abilities you are looking for or that you still don't have, or by the skill you want to make. It can also filter by characters, so you won't get results that are impossible for the others.

The code is fully front-end and was based on a table from a link that is available at the head of the code, but checking it again today seems like it doesn't exist anymore, so I guess the DB can't be remade.

- KFBBS.html - the list itself
- KHBBS.js - script with the whole DB and the basic functionalities
- KHBBS_system.js - contains the parser used to make the DB. Since the page is not available anymore, guess it's kinda useless.

The code is old but it works.
